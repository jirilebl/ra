HTML/PreTeXt:

* Things I've noticed so far, but not gone through all the errors nor
  checked the output thoroughly
  * Well ordering principle custom latex, needs an unnumbered way to do this.
  * some figures not going through since they are more complicated latex,
    need make them into perhaps pdf_t's
  * list of field axioms not getting item numbers rendered correctly
  * finish the further reading chapter

Very long term:

* Add the "crash course on Lebesgue" chapter to Vol II
* Add a chapter on submanifolds and differential forms.

For next edition:

* Should we reduce line length?  Currently it is a bit too long for
  readability.  It seems like it wouldn't actually add too many pages
  to push it down by increasing left/right margins to about 80-85 cpl.
  Another possibility is to just use newpx like diffyqs, that pushes it
  down to 85-90.

* Vol II: Explicitly add "mean value theorem" for functions of several
  variables along a straight line, it has a nice useful statement.  Proof can
  be left as exercise, should come around the definition of gradient.

* Vol II: Add full proof of Green's.  Perhaps to best fit within the current
  framework would be to cut the domain with a rectengular grid.  Under the
  extra assumption that only finitely many points on the boundary have
  horizontal or vertical tangents, a fine enough grid (cutting at all these
  critical points and corners and perhaps at more points to get at most one
  curve in each cell seems like it should make for an easy proof).

* Vol II:  Expand on 11.5, make it more about maximum principle.  Proof of the
  lemma 11.5 for analytic functions can still be left as an exercise.  Proof
  of the maximum principle is also an exercise, but state both, and maybe
  state one or two consequences of the principle other than fundamental
  theorem of calculus.

* Vol I: In 7.6, add an exercise for Picard with parameters, either
  continuous or C^1 perhaps that could use 6.2

* Vol I:
Suggestion from Arthur Busch for theorem 3.4.4:
"
Note that |x_n-y_n| < 1/n allows you to use the squeeze lemma on {x_n-y_n}, and conclude this sequence converges to 0.  Then apply B-W to {y_n} to get a subsequence {y_{n_k}} converging to some c in the domain.  Since the subsequence {x_{n_k} - y_{n_k}} must converge to 0, you can use the algebraic properties of limits to conclude that {x_{n_k}} also converges to c.  
You can then finish the proof with a quick case argument:  case 1:  Either {f(x_{n_k})} diverges or {f(y_{n_k})} diverges, which immediately makes f discontinuous at c.  case 2:  both these sequences converge, and then {f(x_{n_k}) - f(y_{n_k})} converges to Lx - Ly ≥ ε > 0 so at least one of these limits is different than f(c), making f discontinuous at c.
"

Not so necessary but nice to haves

* Add appendix to Vol I on logic and formal proof writing similar to the Pitt
  one

MAYBEs:

* Maybe mark examples that are used in the sequel somehow. (This may be a
  daunting task, and more imprecise than one imagines, as what does "use"
  mean: What if it is used in a later example that isn't used otherwise?
  What if it is used in an optional section?  What if it appears in an
  offhand remark?)
* Maybe mark exercises whose proof is used in the text later.  Same issues
  as above.
* Maybe add appendix to Vol I on construction of the reals.  Perhaps start
  with construction of $\Q$ and then finish with Dedekind cuts.
