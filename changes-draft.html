This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>Add a little bit more detail about induction starting at
  a different \(n.\)
<li>Have Example 0.3.8 start at \(n=0,\) which is more standard
  and demonstrates starting at a different index.
<li>Improve wording of Exercise 0.3.25.
<li>In the footnote in Example 1.1.4 about pianos, don't say "implies",
  it "is related to".
<li>Add a bit more clarity to the proof Proposition 1.1.11 by mentioning
  that \(b\) is an arbitrary lower bound for \(A.\)
<li>Improve wording of Exercise 1.1.2, that is, use the verb "show" to
  emphasize what is to be proved.  Thanks to Hugo Santarem de Araujo
  for pointing this out.
<li>Add a remark to Exercise 1.1.13 to clarify what happens
  for the empty set.
<li>Be clearer as to how the items in Definition 1.2.9 arise
  by taking suprema and infima in the extended reals.
<li>Be a bit more verbose in the proof if (iii) of Proposition 1.3.1.
<li>In 1.4, add a footnote about bounded intervals and that
  if we are writing something like \((a,b),\) we always mean a
  bounded interval unless explicitly specified as possibly infinite.
<li>Add some details to the proof of Proposition 1.5.3.
<li>Add some details to the explanation in Example 1.5.4.
<li>Expand the hint to 2.2.10 a bit to explicitly say that limit being zero
  should be handled separately.
<li>Uncomment the footnote to Exercise 2.4.6 about proving the sequence is
  actually constant (the easy way of proving that
  requires first showing Cauchy anyway).
<li>Add Exercise 2.4.9, a straightforward Cauchy sequence exercise.
<li>In Exercise 2.6.5, explicitly remark on the factorial in the exponent
  in part f so that the reader does not miss it.
<li><b>Fix wording in Exercise 4.1.13</b>, the fact that \(f(x) = x h(x)\)
  for a bounded function \(h\) only applies to part a).
<li>Reword a bit the geometric intuition for the proof of
  the Mean value theorem using Rolle's theorem.
<li>In the proof of the Mean value theorem, write the
  definition of \(g\) in the manner we described in the intuitive
  proof, that is, \(f\) minus an affine function, rather than
  just distributing the minus sign immediately.
<li>In the hint to proving Theorem 4.2.5, suggest a more
  convenient auxiliary function that avoids the
  division by zero issue.
<li>In Exercise 4.2.10 add a remark emphasizing the fact that the
  interval is bounded.
<li>Be more precise in the introduction of Taylor's theorem,
  and be more explicit that is just one of the versions and it requires
  one extra derivative.
<li>When defining the Taylor's theorem remainder
  give the general definition not just the Lagrange formula.
<li>In Exercise 4.3.5, add a footnote remark that \(n+1\) is not
  needed for the result but it would make the exercise much harder.
<li>In Exercise 4.3.7, we are clearly assuming that \(f\)
  is twice differentiable.
<li>Fix the definition of Thomae function in Exercise 5.2.11 to
  explicitly define \(f(0)=1 .\)  That seems the simplest way fix the issue
  of \(f(0) .\)
<li>Make the wording in Exercise 5.2.15 more precise to avoid
  misunderstanding about what is being asked.
<li>Improve the wording in beginning of 5.4, to make explicit for what \(x\)
  are the various powers defined.
<li>In Exercise 5.4.5, add a parenthetical remark to make clear what we mean by the
  interest rate \(x\) (also call it "interest rate" rather than just
  "interest").
<li>Improve the wording of Example 6.1.2, by "other \(x\)" we mean points
  outside of the interval \([-1,1].\)  It is not clear from the wording
  if we are considering \(f_n\) to have a domain \([-1,1],\)
  but that is the logical assumption.  So reword the ending and
  talk about \(x^{2n}\) there.
<li><b>Change Exercise 7.1.11 part c) to fix erratum.</b>  We now require
  \(m \not= n \) as otherwise the exercise is just true for any metric.
<li><b>Change wording in Exercise 7.2.5 to fix erratum.</b>  What is given as
  the way to do it is actually the definition of "totally separated" so call
  it that.
<li>Remove instances of "so-called" as it could be misinterpreted.
