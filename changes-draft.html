This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>Add a little bit more detail about induction starting at
  a different \(n.\)
<li>Have Example 0.3.8 start at \(n=0,\) which is more standard
  and demonstrates starting at a different index.
<li>Improve wording of Exercise 0.3.25.
<li>In the footnote in Example 1.1.4 about pianos, don't say "implies",
  it "is related to".
<li>Add a bit more clarity to the proof Proposition 1.1.11 by mentioning
  that \(b\) is an arbitrary lower bound for \(A.\)
<li>Improve wording of Exercise 1.1.2, that is, use the verb "show" to
  emphasize what is to be proved.  Thanks to Hugo Santarem de Araujo
  for pointing this out.
<li>Add a remark to Exercise 1.1.13 to clarify what happens
  for the empty set.
<li>Be clearer as to how the items in Definition 1.2.9 arise
  by taking suprema and infima in the extended reals.
<li>Be a bit more verbose in the proof if (iii) of Proposition 1.3.1.
<li>Add some details to the proof of Proposition 1.5.3.
<li>Add some details to the explanation in Example 1.5.4.
<li>In the hint to proving Theorem 4.2.5, suggest a more
  convenient auxiliary function that avoids the
  division by zero issue.
<li>Improve the wording of Example 6.1.2, by "other \(x\)" we mean points
  outside of the interval \([-1,1].\)  It is not clear from the wording
  if we are considering \(f_n\) to have a domain \([-1,1],\)
  but that is the logical assumption.  So reword the ending and
  talk about \(x^{2n}\) there.
