This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li><b>Add the condition that \(x^2+y^2=1\) to part a) in Exercise 8.4.6</b> to fix
  an erratum.  This changes the exercise, but actually makes part b)
  possible.
<li>Add Exercise 8.3.16 with another useful counterexample: directional
  derivative in all directions at the origin being zero does not imply
  the function is even continuous.
<li><b>In Exercise 8.6.7 part a), ask for the second derivatives in \(x\) and \(y\)
  to be 2 rather than 1</b> to fix an erratum.  Without this there would
  have to be a factor of \(\frac{1}{2}\) in part b).
<li>When introducing integration of vector fields in 9.3.2,
  quickly motivate why we would want to do that (work done).
<li><b>Change Exercise 10.1.6 to fix erratum</b>.
  In particular, \(h\) must be defined
  in \(S .\)  Avoid the technicality about part of \(R\) being outside \(S\)
  by adding the assumption that \(R \subset S\)
  as that is how the exercise is used (one can always replace \(R\) with
  \(R \cap S\) but let's not make it more complicated.
<li>In Exercise 10.1.8, say explicitly the rectangles are closed.
<li>The name of the section on the Fubini theorem adds the "the".
<li>Example 10.3.8 claim (iii) and Exercise 10.3.10 part b):
  Change the expression for \(m^*(C_k)\) to the much simpler
  \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^k .\)
<li>Strengthen the hypothesis in Proposition 10.5.8 to assume \(\varphi\)
  is continuous to fix an erratum.  This avoids the upper or lower Darboux
  integral, and is all we need.
  This change also <b>changes Exercise 10.5.3 part b)</b> which
  is to prove this proposition.
<li>In the proof of Proposition 11.4.2, mark the "unimodular" for the index.
<li>In Exercise 11.4.11, use \(\arctan\) and \(\arcsin\) for
  consistency.
<li>Make the running title of section 11.5 avoid the "the" to fit on the top
  header nicely.
<li><b>Replace the outline of Exercise 11.6.11</b>
  with the correct outline (using Euler's method)
  of the proof of Peano's existence theorem.
<li>Remove instances of "so-called" as it could be misinterpreted.
<li>Many other minor improvements in wording and minor clarifications.
