This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>When introducing integration of vector fields in 9.3.2,
  quickly motivate why we would want to do that (work done).
<li>Example 10.3.8 claim (iii) and Exercise 10.3.10 part b):
Change the expression for \(m^*(C_k)\) to the much simpler
\(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^k .\)
<li>In Exercise 11.4.11, use \(\arctan\) and \(\arcsin\) for
  consistency.
<li><b>Replace the outline of Exercise 11.6.11</b>
  with the correct outline (using Euler's method)
  of the proof of Peano's existence theorem.
<li>Remove instances of "so-called" as it could be misinterpreted.
